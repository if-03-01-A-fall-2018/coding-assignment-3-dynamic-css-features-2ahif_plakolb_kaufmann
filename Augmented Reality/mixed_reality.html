    <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Mixed reality (MR), sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. Mixed reality takes place not only in the physical world or the virtual world, but is a mix of reality and virtual reality, encompassing both augmented reality and augmented virtuality via immersive technology. <strong>MR not just overlays but anchors virtual objects to the real world and allows the user to interact with the virtual objects.</strong></p>

    <h2>Augmented Virtuality</h2>
      <p>AV is a subcategory of MR which refers to the merging of real world objects into virtual worlds. That means e.g. physical objects or people can interact with the virtual world in real time.This integration is achieved with the use of various techniques. Often streaming video from physical spaces (e.g., via webcam) or using 3-dimensional digitalisation of physical objects.</p>

    <h2>Nett2Know</h2>
      <p>One of the possible applications mixed realities is for training military soldiers. Training solutions are often built on Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) technologies. Examples of technologies used by the Army are Virtual Battlespace 3 and VirTra. As of 2018, the VirTra technology is being purchased by both the civilian and military law enforcement to train personnel in a variety of scenarios. These scenarios include active shooter; domestic violence; military traffic stops, etc. Mixed reality technologies have been used by U.S. Army Research Laboratory scientists to study how this stress affects decision making. With mixed reality, researchers may safely study military service men and women in scenarios where soldiers would not likely survive.</p>
