    <h1>Changes to our Website</h1>
    <p>Shadows and rounded corners already existed in coding assignment 2.
    <p>Changed the background from all websites to black and font color to white.</p>
    <p>Added color fading to h1 on main pages.</p>
    <p>Added gradient to navbar.</p>
    <p>Added icon to navBar.</p>
    <p>Fixed tables on technology.</p>
    <p>Added animation to index.</p>
    <p>Changed index to bootstrap => lost animation.</p>
    <p>All pages to bootstrap.</p>
    <p>Lost gradient on mainpages and navbar gradients still present on the realitie pages.</p>
    <p>Rounded corners on images.</p>
    <p>Animation on index only works in Firefox (to be fixed!).</p>
    <p>All h1 on mainpages have a color fading effect.</p>
    <p>Images are shifted to the right in windowed mode (or smaller resolutions) but not in full screen.</p>
    <p>Removed navbar-text from navbar.</p>
    <p>Fixed fontsize to small on technology and realities.</p>
    <p>Added folder for webapp.</p>
    <p>Added 3 new html files for webapp (webbapp_ui; webapp_host; webapp_user)</p>
    <p>UI is the user interface, where one can choose if you want host or user.</p>
    <p>Host is the page with marker images.</p>
    <p>User will be on mobile. On mobile only works in Firefox tested under Android.</p>
    <p>To use the local server execute window.exe (Mongoose) then type http://localhost:8080 in the search bar and navigate to index.html and open it(should open automatically). Confirmed to work with Google Chrome, Firefox</p>
    <p>If local server is started and the computer and mobile are in the same network you can go into cmd on the computer and type "ipconfig" take the IP-V4 address type it into your phones browser, EXAMPLE: http://192.168.0.0:8080. Confirmed to work with Firefox, DOES NOT work in Google Chrome on mobile</p>
    <p>To go on the site use the link inscomers.net/ar</p>
    <p>Added different models</p>
    <p>Download link on web_app_ui will download, once finished, all markers in a pdf file.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>! ! IMPORTANT ! !</p>
    <p>How to use NGINX (Assumes that you have a fully setup https nginx server!):</p>
    <p>Go into terminal type 'sudo service nginx start'. Go into your browser type https://localhost on the pc, type 'ip addr show' to see the IP you have to use on your mobile, should be under eth1 inet 255.255.255.255 do not use any port(no :8080 behind localhost).</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Added buttons to cycle through markers on webapp_host(JS to that done).</p>
    <p>Things tried:</p>
    <p>             3D models: works with obj-models</p>
    <p>             Images: jpg; png -> seems to be mirrored</p>
