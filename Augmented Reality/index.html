      <h1>Augmented Reality</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>In fundamental terms, the expression augmented reality, often abbreviated to AR, refers to a simple combination of real and virtual (computer-generated) worlds. Given a real subject, captured on video or camera, the technology enhances that real-world image with extra layers of digital information. Those of us who enjoy watching television coverage of sport will already have experienced a basic form of augmented reality in action. Picture the cricket pitch on which a logo for a well-known sponsor miraculously appears, or an Olympic swimming race where a line indicating the position of the current world record holder appears ahead of the competitors moving frantically through the water.</p>

        <h2>Evolution of Augmented Reality</h2>
          <p> In 1901 L. Frank Baum first has the idea for Augmented Reality
          The first Augmented Reality-System was created by Louis Rosenberg with the name "Virtual Fixtures" at the United States Air Force Research Laboratory
          Augmented Reality head up displays in fighter jets were the earliest use case of Augmented Reality-Technology and are still used today.</p>
          <p>Boeing researcher Thomas Caudell coined the term augmented reality in 1990, to describe how the head-mounted displays that electricians used when assembling complicated wiring harnesses worked. One of the first commercial applications of Augmented Reality technology was the yellow "first down" line that began appearing in televised football games sometime in 1998. Today, Google glass and heads-up displays in car windshields are perhaps the most well-known consumer Augmented Reality products, but the technology is used in many industries including healthcare, public safety, gas and oil, tourism and marketing.</p>
