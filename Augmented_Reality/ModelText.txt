Teratophoneus ("monstrous murderer") is a genus of carnivorous tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur (Gattung fleischfressender Dinosaurier) which lived during the late Cretaceous period (late Campanian age, about 77 to 76 million years ago) in what is now Utah, United States. It is known from an incomplete skull and postcranial skeleton recovered from the Kaiparowits Formation. It was specifically named T. curriei in honor of Philip J. Currie.
