    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical.</p>

    <h2>Technology (for VR)</h2>
    <p>All modern VR displays are based on technology developed for smartphones including: gyroscopes and motion sensors for tracking head, hand, and body positions; small HD screens for stereoscopic displays; and small, lightweight and fast processors. These components led to relative affordability for independent VR developers, and lead to the 2012 Oculus Rift Kickstarter offering the first independently developed VR headset.

    <h2>Nett2Know</h2>
    <p>There are many health and safety considerations of virtual reality. Most virtual reality systems come with consumer warnings, including: seizures; developmental issues in children; trip-and-fall and collision warnings; discomfort; repetitive stress injury; and interference with medical devices. Some users may experience twitches, seizures or blackouts while using VR headsets, even if they do not have a history of epilepsy and have never had blackouts or seizures before. Since these symptoms are more common among people under the age of 20, children are advised against using VR headsets. While wearing VR headsets, people quickly lose awareness of their real-world surroundings and may injure themselves by tripping over, or colliding with real-world objects.</p>
